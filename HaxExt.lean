# Extensions to the Lean libraries of hax's backend

Declarations that the pinned `Aeneas` and `CoreModels` libraries lack and that
generated or stub code needs in order to elaborate. They model Rust's
`core`/`alloc`, not Plonky3, so they are shared by every crate.

Each declaration here is a candidate to upstream to `cryspen/hax-lean` or
`cryspen/aeneas`, and is deleted once the pinned revision provides it.
